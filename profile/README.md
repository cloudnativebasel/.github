## How we are üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

We are a group of tech enthusiasts from Basel who are passionate about the latest developments in the field of Cloud Native and related technologies.

## Our goal üèÅ

Our goal is to create a vibrant community that regularly interacts in person to exchange knowledge and experiences. To achieve this, we organize live presentations on various tech topics related to Cloud Native, providing a great opportunity to learn from experts and discover new ideas.

## Cloud Native ecosystem üå±

The Cloud Native ecosystem encompasses various aspects, key technologies, and related fields that revolve around the development, deployment, and management of cloud-native applications. Here are some important components of the Cloud Native ecosystem:

- **Containerization:** Containers, such as Docker, provide lightweight and isolated environments for deploying and running applications consistently across different platforms and infrastructure.
- **Orchestration:** Orchestration platforms, like Kubernetes, enable the automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and efficient resource utilization.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Cloud Native applications are often built using a microservices architecture, where applications are divided into smaller, loosely coupled services that can be independently developed, deployed, and scaled.
- **Service Mesh:** Service mesh technologies, such as Istio and Linkerd, facilitate secure and reliable communication between services in a microservices architecture, providing observability, traffic management, and resilience features.
- **Immutable Infrastructure:** Cloud Native applications leverage the concept of immutable infrastructure, where infrastructure components, including servers and containers, are treated as disposable and can be easily replaced or upgraded.
- **DevOps Practices:** Cloud Native development embraces DevOps principles, combining development and operations teams to automate and streamline the application lifecycle, including continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure as code.
- **Cloud Providers:** Cloud Native applications often leverage cloud platforms, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), to take advantage of their managed services, scalability, and global availability.
- **Observability and Monitoring:** Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger are used to monitor and gain insights into the performance, health, and behavior of Cloud Native applications and infrastructure.
- **Serverless Computing:** Serverless platforms, such as AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions, allow developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers, enabling event-driven, highly scalable architectures.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the building, testing, and deployment of Cloud Native applications, ensuring frequent releases and efficient development workflows.
- **WebAssembly:** WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format that allows running high-performance code on the web. It enables executing code written in various programming languages, such as C, C++, Rust, and TypeScript, in the browser. WebAssembly is increasingly used in the Cloud Native ecosystem to enhance the performance, portability, and interoperability of web applications.
- **Web Development:** Cloud Native web development focuses on building scalable, containerized web applications that can be deployed and managed using cloud-native technologies and practices. This includes leveraging frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, serverless architectures, CDN-based content delivery, and cloud-native databases and storage solutions. Web developers in the Cloud Native ecosystem aim to create efficient, scalable, and resilient web applications that can seamlessly integrate with other cloud-native components.
- **Security and Governance:** Security practices and tools, such as container image scanning, identity and access management, and network security policies, play a crucial role in ensuring the security and compliance of Cloud Native applications.

These aspects and technologies are just a glimpse of the Cloud Native ecosystem, which continues to evolve and expand as new technologies and practices emerge.

## Typically Basel üá®üá≠
